# Application Components and Structure

## 1. Research Proposal (5 pages max)

**Purpose**: Address Merit Indicators under "Merit of the Proposal" criterion

**Required elements**:
- **Title**: Clear, accessible to general audience
- **Background and context**: Why does this research matter?
- **Objectives**: Specific, feasible goals for grant period (typically 5 years)
- **Methodology**: How will you achieve objectives? Why is this approach appropriate?
- **Significance**: What will we know/be able to do that we can't now?
- **Feasibility**: Why can YOU do this? What makes it realistic?
- **Timeline**: Rough breakdown of activities across grant period

**Key Merit Indicators to address**:
- Originality and significance of research proposal
- Feasibility and appropriateness of the proposed approach
- Clarity and quality of the proposal presentation

**Critical writing guidance**:
- **Lead with motivation** (Tip #6): Non-specialists must understand why this matters
- **Define terms**: Don't assume shared vocabulary across subfields
- **Show, don't tell**: Instead of "This is significant," explain the impact
- **Connect to past work**: Reference your CCV to show you're prepared (Tip #2)

**Self-reference citation format**:
- Use **[C#]** for conference papers (where # is the number in your CCV)
- Use **[J#]** for journal papers (where # is the number in your CCV)
- This format makes it easy for reviewers to cross-reference your CCV
- Example: "Building on our prior work on Bayesian inference [J12, C34], we propose..."
- The numbers correspond to the publication list order in your CCV
- This convention helps reviewers quickly verify your track record in the proposed area

**Common pitfall**: Writing for specialists in your subfield. NSERC committees are cross-disciplinary. If a reviewer outside your area can't understand your proposal's significance, you lose points.

## 2. Common CV (CCV) - Past Contributions

**Purpose**: Address Merit Indicators under "Excellence of the Researcher" criterion

**What it demonstrates**:
- Research contributions (publications, presentations, invited talks)
- HQP training record (students supervised, their outcomes)
- Other contributions (reviewing, editing, knowledge mobilization, EDI activities)

**How it connects to proposal**:
- Shows you have expertise to do proposed research
- Demonstrates track record of productivity
- Proves you can train HQP successfully

**Key strategy** (Tip #2):
- Ensure CCV aligns with proposed research direction
- If proposing new direction, explain how past work provides foundation
- Highlight students' success to support HQP training plan

## 3. HQP Training Plan

**Purpose**: Address Merit Indicators under "Training of HQP" criterion

**Required elements**:
- **Current and recent HQP**: Number of students, their levels (MSc, PhD, postdoc)
- **Training activities**: Regular meetings, seminars, workshops, presentation opportunities
- **Skill development**: Technical skills and professional skills (writing, presenting, collaboration)
- **Supervision record**: Completion rates, time-to-degree, career outcomes
- **Training environment**: Lab resources, departmental support, collaborative opportunities
- **Connection to research**: How will HQP contribute to proposed research?
- **EDI considerations**: Inclusive training environment, support for diverse trainees

**Key Merit Indicators to address**:
- Quality and impact of proposed HQP training
- Appropriateness of training environment and opportunities
- (From Excellence criterion) Contributions to training of HQP - demonstrated in CCV

**Common pitfall**: Treating HQP section as afterthought. This is one of three evaluation criteria - give it serious attention.

**What "Exceptional" looks like**:
- Strong supervision track record (timely completions, student success)
- Clear training philosophy and concrete activities
- Students go on to successful careers (academia, industry, government)
- Inclusive, supportive training environment
- Integration of training with research objectives

## 4. Budget Justification

**Purpose**: Explain how you'll use requested funds

**What to include**:
- **Explanation of major expenses**: Why do you need this equipment, travel, student support?
- **Connection to proposal**: How does each expense enable proposed research?
- **Realistic estimates**: Based on current prices, institutional policies

**Key strategy** (Tip #3):
- Justify clearly but don't inflate
- For early-career applicants, modest budgets are fine
- Reviewers check that budget aligns with proposed activities (Tip #2)

**Common pitfall**: Requesting expensive items without clear justification of necessity
