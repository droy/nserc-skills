# Writing for Cross-Disciplinary Committee

**Critical context**: Your NSERC review committee includes experts from related but distinct areas. Many reviewers will not be specialists in your subfield.

**This means**:
- A theoretical physicist may review an applied physics proposal
- A molecular biologist may review a computational biology proposal
- A pure mathematician may review an applied math proposal

**Implications for writing**:

## 1. Lead with Motivation, Not Methodology
❌ Bad: "We will use persistent homology to compute Betti numbers for point cloud data..."
✅ Good: "Large datasets often have hidden geometric structure. We will develop mathematical tools to detect this structure, enabling applications in..."

## 2. Define Technical Terms
Don't assume shared vocabulary. Brief explanations keep non-specialists engaged.

**Example**: "We will study *martingales* (sequences of random variables with a specific memory-less property) to model..."

## 3. Use Analogies and Examples
Make abstract concepts concrete.

**Example**: "This algorithm is analogous to how GPS systems triangulate position - using multiple noisy measurements to infer precise location."

## 4. Explain Significance in Accessible Terms
Non-specialists can't evaluate technical significance directly, but they can understand impact.

❌ Bad: "This advances the theory of L-functions"
✅ Good: "This connects two previously separate areas of mathematics, potentially enabling new approaches to longstanding problems in number theory"

## 5. Structure for Skimming
- Clear section headings
- Topic sentences that convey main points
- Figures/diagrams that convey key ideas visually
- **Remember**: Reviewers read many applications; make yours easy to understand quickly

## 6. Test with Non-Specialist Readers
Before submitting, ask a colleague outside your subfield to read your proposal. If they can't explain why your work matters, revise.

# Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

## Pitfall 1: Writing for Specialists
**Problem**: Using jargon, assuming shared background, diving into technical details without motivation

**Fix**: Apply Tip #6 relentlessly. Test with non-specialist readers. Lead with "why this matters" before "how we'll do it."

## Pitfall 2: Treating Sections as Independent
**Problem**: Writing proposal, CCV, HQP plan in isolation without ensuring coherence

**Fix**: Apply Tip #2. Explicitly connect components. If proposing new direction, explain how past work provides foundation.

## Pitfall 3: Incomplete Merit Indicator Coverage
**Problem**: Addressing some items but missing others, assuming reviewers will infer

**Fix**: Use the Merit Indicators checklist reference file. Apply Tip #8 and #9. Even brief mentions for less central items.

## Pitfall 4: Vague Significance Claims
**Problem**: Saying "This is important" without explaining why or what the impact is

**Fix**: Be concrete. Who benefits? What becomes possible? What problems get solved?

## Pitfall 5: Unrealistic Scope or Timeline
**Problem**: Proposing too much for grant period, overly ambitious plans

**Fix**: Apply Tip #4. Better to be focused and feasible. Acknowledge challenges and explain mitigation.

## Pitfall 6: Neglecting HQP Training
**Problem**: Treating HQP section as afterthought, generic description of training

**Fix**: Remember HQP is one of three criteria. Be specific about training activities. Show evidence of past success. Connect to research objectives.

## Pitfall 7: Budget-Application Mismatch
**Problem**: Budget doesn't align with proposed activities, or requests aren't justified

**Fix**: Check Tip #2 cross-component consistency. Explain why you need each major item. For early-career, don't inflate (Tip #3).

## Pitfall 8: Ignoring Instructions
**Problem**: Missing page limits, wrong formatting, incomplete sections

**Fix**: Apply Tip #10. Read instructions carefully. Verify current requirements. Double-check before submitting.

# Application Timeline and Strategy

## Typical Timeline (Assuming Fall Deadline)

**12-18 months before**:
- Read successful grants from colleagues (Tip #1, #7)
- Review current Merit Indicators document and application requirements (Tip #10)
- Plan research program for next 5 years

**6-12 months before**:
- Draft research proposal
- Update CCV with recent contributions
- Draft HQP training plan
- Get feedback from colleagues

**3-6 months before**:
- Revise based on feedback
- Check Merit Indicator coverage systematically
- Test proposal with non-specialist readers for accessibility
- Prepare budget justification

**1-3 months before**:
- Final revisions
- Cross-component consistency checks (Tip #2)
- Professional editing if needed
- Verify all requirements met (Tip #10)

**2 weeks before**:
- Final proofread
- Submit through online system
- Verify submission received

## Strategic Considerations

**For early-career applicants**:
- Emphasize trajectory and promise
- Modest budgets are fine (Tip #3)
- Show how graduate work positioned you for independent research
- Highlight teaching and mentorship activities even without full supervision record

**For established researchers**:
- Show sustained productivity
- Demonstrate leadership (keynotes, editorial roles, large grants)
- Strong HQP outcomes (student careers)
- Balance innovation with track record

**For interdisciplinary research**:
- Explain contributions to each field clearly
- Make connections between disciplines accessible
- Show you understand both areas (via CCV)
- Extra attention to Tip #6 (general audience)
