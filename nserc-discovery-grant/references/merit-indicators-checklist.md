- [ ] Invited talks, keynotes at conferences
- [ ] Research grants secured (previous track record)
- [ ] Awards, honors, recognition
- [ ] For early-career: Trajectory and promise evident from limited record

**Contributions to training of HQP**:
- [ ] Number and level of HQP supervised (current and completed)
- [ ] Student outcomes and career success
- [ ] Evidence of effective mentorship
- [ ] For early-career: Teaching experience, mentorship activities even without full supervision record

**Contributions to other research-related activities**:
- [ ] Knowledge mobilization (public engagement, industry partnerships, policy impact)
- [ ] Service to research community (reviewing, conference organization, editorial boards)
- [ ] EDI contributions (equity, diversity, inclusion activities)

## Merit of the Proposal

**Originality and significance of research proposal**:
- [ ] Clear statement of research objectives
- [ ] Explanation of what's new/original about this work
- [ ] Significance: What will we know/be able to do that we can't now?
- [ ] Positioning within broader research landscape
- [ ] Potential for high impact in field

**Feasibility and appropriateness of the proposed approach**:
- [ ] Detailed methodology
- [ ] Evidence of feasibility (preliminary results, past success with similar methods)
- [ ] Discussion of challenges and how you'll address them
- [ ] Realistic timeline
- [ ] Appropriate level of ambition (not too cautious, not overreaching)

**Clarity and quality of proposal presentation**:
